🏥 Doctor Consultation Platform (In Progress)
📌 Overview
This is a web-based platform aimed at helping users consult with doctors from various specialties. Users will be able to either manually search for doctors or interact with an AI-powered chatbot that suggests the appropriate doctor based on their symptoms.

🔑 Key Features (Planned)
Doctor and patient login/registration

Display of doctor tiles with ratings and specialization

Chatbot to suggest relevant specialists

Appointment booking system

This project is currently under development. The chatbot will use an open-source language model (like TinyLlama) to understand user symptoms and recommend the right kind of doctor.
